This report is written in order to highlight the work performed during the specializa-tion project. The project is about optimal resource allocation in private clouds. The
report contains three dierent parts. The rst part is studying the state of the art of resource allocation in cloud computing. It continues with the introduction of some dif-
ferent scenarios, and in last part, an optimization algorithm that addresses the speciedscenario(s) using linear programming is proposed. Finally, dierent results are analyzed
and compared and some future work directions are drawn.
